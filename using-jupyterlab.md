# Using Jupyterlab

1.  Open a Windows Terminal with bash:  `Start > Terminal`

2.  Run `jupyterlab_start`

3.  Python will run the JupyterLab server in the terminal window, and start a browser with JupyterLab.  You can minimize the terminal window, but keep it running while you're working on Jupyter Notebooks.
